# reloy

Reloy was written in 2005 for a work presentation to demonstrate some very basic implementations of several open source libraries

Includes:
Struts
Hibernate
HSQLDB
DisplayTag
SiteMesh

This was tested on recent versions of Tomcat.  It is not compatible with Tomcat 10 - the renamed j2ee packages alone would require a complete rewrite.  It does work on Tomcat 9.
